<h3>Data and struct</h3>
To do this game I used A char matrix to simulate a map and a lot of variables

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
To move emoji you can press WASD and press Enter every time. When the emoji get a mooshroom, it get a point, but if you find a bomb or a poisonous one you lose the match or lose some points. The game finishes when the emoji get all the mooshrooms without lose. You can also see a mini-leaderboard of the recent points
